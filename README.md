## Best Practices

- Organizing Tests: Structure tests by features or components to maintain clarity and scalability. [Cypress Documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/app/get-started/why-cypress).
- Selecting Elements: Use data attributes (e.g., `data-cy`) for selecting elements to ensure selectors are resilient to changes in styling or structure. [Cypress Best Practices](https://docs.cypress.io/app/core-concepts/best-practices).
- Avoiding Flaky Tests: Implement assertions and controls to prevent tests from being flaky, ensuring consistent test outcomes. [Dev.to](https://dev.to/)
